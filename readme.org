* "The Little Schemer" exercises, solutions and notes

This repository contains my solutions and notes on the exercises from the book "[[file:book.pdf][The Little Schemer]]".

This repository uses /literate programming/ to manage notes and code. Both notes and code can be found in the [[file:little-schemer.org][little-schemer.org]] file.

All code is also extracted to the [[file:src/][src]] directory, with one source file per chapter.
